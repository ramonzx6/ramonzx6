## about me

📖 Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at the Rio de Janeiro State University.

💭 I'm really into fantasy-related things, such as books, movies, RPG games, etc.

🔎 I have a deep interest in Software Engineering, Software Architecture and DevOps. Feel free to hit me up about any of these topics!
